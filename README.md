# 🍃 Sprig Games

This is a small collection of all the games I have made for [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com). Sprig is a custom game engine, as well as a custom handheld game console-- the only way to get your own Sprig is by making a game!

## Hue Havoc

This is the first game I made for Sprig, in summer of 2024. It's a 2-player splatoon-style turf war game, where you and another player have 60 seconds to cover as much of the arena as possible!

## Monster Mayhem

Monster Mayhem was made over the course of a few days for the 2024 Sprig Halloween Jam (it [won first place](https://cloud-823i7p2mz-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png))! It's a Halloween themed whack-a-mole game with some pretty nice art, if I do say so myself. Music made with the help of [@RuadhanKM](https://github.com/ruadhanKM/)!
